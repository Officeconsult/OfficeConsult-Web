requests are performed as json,
all requests to the app contain the following two fields
inside the request body

->  COMMAND
->  DATA

the COMMAND tells the server what function to use when parsing the DATA.
the DATA varries from function to function, but is in general used to
evaluate a series of expressions, the result returned depends on the COMMAND
but is usually a boolean to the server, or a dictionary that is to be
sent as json back to the client.
